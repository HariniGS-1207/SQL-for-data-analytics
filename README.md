#  SQL for Data Analysis
## What I did
- Loaded ecommerce CSV dataset into [SQLite/MySQL/Postgres]
- Wrote queries to produce: monthly revenue, top products, ARPU, customer lifetime value, etc.

## How to run
1. Open `sql/task4_queries.sql` in your SQL client and run queries.
2. For SQLite: open `ecommerce.db` with DB Browser.
3. Screenshots are in `/screenshots`.

## Notes
- Indexes added: `orders(customer_id)`, `orders(order_date)`.
